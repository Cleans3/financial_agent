Consolidated Financial Statements and Accompanying Notes
For the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2024
1. Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation — The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries are included herein. Intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Certain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified
to conform to the current period presentation. Use of Estimates — The preparation of financial statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
2. Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company derives revenue
from long-term service contracts, subscription-based arrangements, and point-in-time product sales. For contracts with variable
consideration, estimates are constrained to amounts that are not probable of significant reversal. Payment terms generally range
from 30 to 90 days, and no significant financing component is deemed present.
